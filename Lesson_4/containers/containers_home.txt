1. Make performance test and compare performance betwee std::set<T> and std::unordered_set<T>:
  - add lots of items of type T = int
  - add lots of items of type T = std::string
  - add lots of items of type T = int with many duplicates
  - add lots of items of type T = std::string with many duplicates
