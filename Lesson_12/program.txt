Brief theory:
1. About threads memory model within the same process
2. Mutual exclusion, semaphore, wait and notify
3. Condition variable, lockable types, shared locking
4. Asynchronous programming, shared storage
5. Event-Listener pattern

1. threads [0..5]
2. atomic [1]
3. mutex [1..9; 2, 2_1 - exercises]
4. condition_variable [
5. event_listener [
6. asynchronous [

Advanced:
7. atomic [2..5]
