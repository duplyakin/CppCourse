1. Below is the table with the classes of public networks:

Class	Leftmost bits	Start address	Finish address
A	0xxx	         0.0.0.0        127.255.255.255
B	10xx	         128.0.0.0	191.255.255.255
C	110x	         192.0.0.0	223.255.255.255
D	1110	         224.0.0.0	239.255.255.255
E	1111	         240.0.0.0	255.255.255.255

Calculate the noumber of different adresses within each class of network.

2. Make some refactoring for 'server_2.cpp' implementing non-blocking main thread Server.
This Server should receive user commands in main thread and send terminating signal to all peers.
(see 'server_2_1.cpp' for solution). I will probably need some minor changes in 'client_2.cpp'
(see 'client_2_1.cpp' for such changes).

3. Use function 'getaddrinfo()' to fill 'sockaddr' structure instead of manual filling
(see 'server_2_2.cpp' and 'client_2_2.cpp' for solutions).

4. Create multi-channel chat server (see 'server_2_3.cpp' for solution).

5. Use http protocol instead of hand-written one in multi-channel chat server
(see 'server_3_1.cpp' for solution).
