1. Implement other arithmetic operations on complex values:

Use operations_6.cpp and provide other operations:

binary operations: -, *, /, ==, !=
unary operations: -, +, prefix and postfix ++, --
assignment operations: -=, *=, /=

Think carefully, what type return value should have?
What operations should be 'const' and what should not?

Avoid code duplication.

2. Write unit-test and check correctness of these operations
using std::complex from <complex> header file.
