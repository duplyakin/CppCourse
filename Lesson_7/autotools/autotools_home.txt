1. Make another library 'libwrite.so' which depends on 'libprint.so'. Use 'libwrite_la_LIBADD' options.
This library should contain at least one global function, which must use any function from 'libprint.so'.
Call this function somewhere from main_4.cpp.

2. Move 'libprint.cpp' and 'libwrite.cpp' sources into separate directories 'print' and 'write'.
Supply Makefile.am for both directories and make all necessary changes in 'configure.ac' and
throughout the build system.

3. Clone git-repository: 'https://github.com/orcchg/MoneyWatcherAlpha.git".
Build the project using Autotools, build unit-tests also. Run console (and GUI) main program, run unit-tests.
What 3rd-party libraries are in use?

{GUI program is not completed, but is actually a working sample based on Qt5.
If you failed to build GUI program try to figure out, which libraries are missing.
Qt5 could be missing, so fix such conflict or disable GUI program build at all (removing Qt5 dependency)}

4. Clone git-repository: 'https://github.com/python-git/python.git' - Sources of Python 3.
Configure and build the project. Run resulting binary executable 'python'. Install it in Linux OS.
