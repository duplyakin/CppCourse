1. Implement a class hierarchy "Geometric polygons". Write a base class with methods: getColor(), calculateSquare(), getName();
Write derived classes: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Ellipse and provide some property calculation methods and getters.
Make samples.

2. Use the following base logger class:

class Logger {
public:
  void log(const std::string& message) {
    std::string preparedMessage = prepareString(message);
	doLog(preparedMessage);
  }
  
protected:
  virtual std::string prepareString(const std::string& message) {}
  virtual void doLog(const std::string& message) {}
};

Make various logger classes, writing into: stdout, std::string, file. Override virtual methods.
Make samples.

3. Write class Matrix with all base operations as described in Lesson_3 homework and
inherit SquareMatrix from it. Demonstrate how some arithmetic operations could work with both
accidental matrix (instance of Matrix) and square matrix (instance of SquareMatrix): +, -, *, @=, transpose().
Make Samples.
