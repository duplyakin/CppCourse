1. Write a program which takes a file expressions.txt, reads each line
from it and prints the result of calculation of every expression.

For example, read the following line from the file:

5 + 7

And write the following answer to the standard output:

5 + 7 = 12

For strings do a concatenation:

Hello + , + World + !

Answer: Hello, World!

Separate words with whitespaces if necessary.

2. Get some string from stdin and write them into an empty file.

3. Solve the previous task using std::copy() from <algorithm>. Do not forget
to use std::ostream_iterator<> from <iterator>.

4. Read square matrix NxN from stdin and write it into an empty file.
You should read integer N >= 0 first and handle the case, when N <= 0.
