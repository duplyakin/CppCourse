1. Modify string_3.cpp and trim leading whitespaces as well.

2. Also, trim all duplicate whitespaces and leave just one between each word, in string_3.cpp.
Note: use std::unique() function from <algorithm>, but use it wisely!

3. Compare performance between std::string and std::vector<char>.
Provide lots of push-operations and measures time elapsed.
